TODO:
Motor: Text interface. differnt ramming target sprite perchance.
Character: Code the +80 characters :D.
Game: The rest of the game.
Char.Class idea: Psyquic shot: controll a proyectile. The proyectile has infinite reach. It moves 10 tiles per act. turn subdivision. If it didnt end on the first turn, on the
next turn you cant decide what to do, you will keep moving the ball.

Bogfixes: enemies trying (and failing) to attack through walls
	camera remaining attached to path if path hasnt been walked yet

idea:
path indicator having same theme as ambient
