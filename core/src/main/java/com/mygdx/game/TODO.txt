TODO:
Motor: differnt ramming target sprite perchance.
Character: Code the +80 characters :D.
Game: The rest of the game.
Char.Class idea: Psyquic shot: controll a proyectile. The proyectile has infinite reach. It moves 10 tiles per act. turn subdivision. If it didnt end on the first turn, on the
next turn you cant decide what to do, you will keep moving the ball.
Text: add custom text gradients and text wave and text bounce
Camara: if on free mode, camara detaching from anima and to be limited at the wall

Bogfixes: enemies trying (and failing) to attack through walls
	camera remaining attached to path if path hasnt been walked yet
Stage: conserve x or y position, relative to the screenwarps and spawn position
Textbox: choose code implementation
multiplayer.
Text: trailing colored text, rapidly disapearing and converting into its supposed real color
	Text bugfix: fix the unintentional trailing colored text, the one rapidly disapearing and convering into its supposed real color


idea:
path indicator having same theme as ambient
