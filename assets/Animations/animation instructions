Here are the instructions on how to make an animation.
If the file doesn't start with "?" or "^" it will not run that instruction, so you can write on animation files, although you cannot start a word with "^" or "?", as spaces are taken as newlines. Writting on files might also have (minimal) performance issues.
Explanation of format: 
Add texture:
Start with "?" to start a texture command. Then, you have to add the number of frames you want the texture to be played for. Cannot have decimals (I can't make decimal frames happen)
Then add another "?" and the name of the texture. THE TEXTURE HAS TO BE IN THE ATLAS SPRITE. To finish the command, add ";" and a new line.
If you want the sprite to be moved tiles (have to make it so you can also move pixels) before ";" add ":" and, if 'x' add the number of tiles; if 'y' add "y" and the number of tiles; and if both add the number of tiles for 'x', then ":" and the number of tiles for 'y'. You can make these numbers positive, negative or decimal.
I am pretty sure the texture files cannot have spaces in their name.
Add repetition:
If you start a like with "^" and then a number, it will jump that many instructions upwards, once.
Here are some examples:

?5?CharaLeft;
?10?CharaRight;
^2;
?15?CharaLeft:1:1;
?20?CharaLeft:-1:-1;
?25?CharaLeft:y1;
?30?CharaLeft:y-1;
