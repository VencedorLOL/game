This is runnable, if the file doesn't start with "?" or "^" it will not run.
Explanation of format: 
Add texture:
Start with "?" to start a texture command. Then, you have to add the number of frames you want the texture to be played for. Cannot have decimals (I can't make decimal frames happen)
Then add another "?" and the name of the texture. THE TEXTURE HAS TO BE IN THE ATLAS SPRITE. To finish the command, add ";" and a new line.
If you want the sprite to be moved tiles (have to make it so you can also move pixels) before ";" add ":" and, if 'x' add the number of tiles; if 'y' add "y" and the number of tiles; and if both add the number of tiles for 'x', then ":" and the number of tiles for 'y'. You can make these numbers positive, negative or decimal.
Add repetition:
If you start a like with "^" and then a number, it will jump that many instructions upwards, once.
Here are some examples:



?5?CharaLeft;
?10?CharaRight;
^2;
?15?CharaLeft:1:1;
?20?CharaLeft:-1:-1;
?25?CharaLeft:y1;
?30?CharaLeft:y-1;
